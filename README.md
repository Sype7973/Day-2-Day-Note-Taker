# Day-2-Day-Note-Taker

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- I wanted to create a note-taker that used express.js to create back-end functionality and allow users to create and delete daily notes.
- I wanted to use the abilities I had learn't in express.js and node to create a back-end for a javascript app.
- My app allows users to make simple notes for their daily tasks and allows the user to delete those tasks once completed
- I learn't that modular routing is the foundation of back-end functionality using express.js and back-end can be a lot of fun putting all the pieces together


## Installation

You can either download the public github repo to have the Note Taker on your local system; or follow the link below to be provided the Heroku deployed application:

Badges aren't necessary, per se, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.


Thank you!
