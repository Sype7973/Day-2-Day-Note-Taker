# Day-2-Day-Note-Taker

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- I wanted to create a note-taker that used express.js to create back-end functionality and allow users to create and delete daily notes.
- I wanted to use the abilities I had learn't in express.js and node to create a back-end for a javascript app.
- My app allows users to make simple notes for their daily tasks and allows the user to delete those tasks once completed
- I learn't that modular routing is the foundation of back-end functionality using express.js and back-end can be a lot of fun putting all the pieces together
